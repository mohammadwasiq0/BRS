## [Book Recommender System](https://mohammadwasiq0-brs-app-sruhni.streamlit.app/)

- This project has two main objectives.
- First objective is to show **Top 20** books of taken dataset.
  - This is Popularity Based Recommender System
- And the second objective is to recommend 5 books to user entered book.
  - This is Collaborative Filtering Type of recommendation
  - And in this project the major concern was to focus on user ratings and make recommendation based on that
- At the beginning data merging and data cleaning was performed.
- **Streamlit**'framework was being used and web app was created.
- The web app was then deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

- In this project, **Cosine Similarity** was used for building collaborative filtering recommender system.
 

## Conclusion 
- Both Popularity and Collaborative firterling are working at some extend.
- In collaborative filtering, cosine similarity pays huge role and it's results were more consistent.
